## 2026-04-10 19:42 - Added Phase 2 governance action-entry safety

- Scope: governance layer, transient action contract, and action-entry boundary tests
- Done:
  - added narrow transient Action contract with typed identity, scope linkage, and basis binding
  - added separate Policy, Approval, and Readiness models with distinct typed verdict/state families
  - added fail-closed action-entry evaluation for policy, approval binding, freshness, scope match, blockers, and escalation
  - added negative tests for selection-as-permission drift, raw action start attempts, stale approval reuse, and approval/readiness flattening
- Validation: targeted governance pytest files passed and full `python -m pytest -q` passed with 31 tests
- Current state: Phase 2 governance now exists as a separate layer that gates action start without mutating truth or implementing execution
- Next step: build the Phase 3 context, research, decision, and conditional planning slice on top of the governed action boundary
