## 2026-04-10 19:53 - Added Phase 3 cognitive contracts

- Scope: truth-first context, bounded research, proposal, selection, and conditional planning
- Done:
  - added cognitive context package and assembler anchored on canonical truth with scope-checked support inputs
  - added source-aware research request/result contracts with distinct findings, inferences, uncertainty, and recommendation fields
  - added proposal and selection contracts with 0..3 honest option enforcement and explicit non-selection outcomes
  - added conditional planning gate and plan artifact model that refuses unjustified default planning
  - added Phase 3 boundary tests for context leakage, proposal padding, selection non-permission, and plan/action separation
- Validation: targeted Phase 3 pytest files passed and full `python -m pytest -q` passed with 44 tests
- Current state: Phase 3 cognitive contracts now exist as a separate layer without execution, memory, or orchestration creep
- Next step: build the Phase 4 governed execution, outcome, and evaluation slice on top of the current action and governance boundaries
